# Company Dashboard Internship Project

Internship project focused on building a Streamlit-based dashboard for visualizing and analyzing turbine performance data, operational KPIs, and revenue trends using SQLAlchemy and Altair.

#Technologies Used:
- Python: Main programming language for backend logic.
- Streamlit: Used for creating interactive, web-based dashboards.
- SQLAlchemy: ORM for database interactions.
- Altair: Visualization library used for creating interactive charts and graphs.
- Microsoft SQL Server: Database used to store turbine operational data.


## Project Description
This dashboard connects to a SQL Server database, processes turbine operational data, and visualizes key metrics such as wind speed, active power, revenue generation, and performance load factor (PLF).

## How to Run
- Install required libraries (`pip install streamlit sqlalchemy altair pandas pyodbc`)
- Configure the database connection
- Run the app with: `streamlit run app.py`
